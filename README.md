# Domain-specific-ambiguity
This is a tool for comparing terms of different domains, based on word embeddings models created from
the documents of different wikipedia portals. The portals are Computer Science, Electronic Engineering,
Mechanical Engineering, Sports, Medicine.

The project includes three packages:

1. domain_analysis: includes utilities to get statistics and manipulate the domain files.
2. vector_comparison: includes the utilities to build the word embeddings.
3. validation: includes files to evaluate the results.
