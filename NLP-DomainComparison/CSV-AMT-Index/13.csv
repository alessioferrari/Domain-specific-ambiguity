consequence,He showed how to subsume the complex von Neumann proof of construction universality (and hence self-reproducing machines) into a consequence of computation universality in a 1-dimensional CA.,Time in the relativistic probability conservation equation is Einstein’s time and is a consequence of implicitly adopting Hypothesis I.,The evolution of these two lineages is thought to have occurred as a consequence of quarantine measures.,The worst possible consequence that can result is leakage of radioactive materials (U-235 or Pu-239).,The change was made as a consequence of two fatal shootings by .22 calibre semi automatic air rifles.
